# SincUltimate

No matter how hard CoreDumping will try, Impossible will never a great enough challenge. That's where Ultimate Difficulty comes in! You start out 30k in debt and half to crawl your way to your first product without the help of a publisher, without any contracts or deals. Stocks aren't an option either at the start, so you have to be careful with your choices!

## What does this mod do?
This mod adds a new difficulty called "Ultimate," and it makes the game __a lot__ harder. Here's what it changes:

- You start with -30k in debt and have a 120k loan automatically applied
- Founders start at 40 years old
- Founders have 65% skill in the character creation screen*
- Founders get half the specialization stars*
- Half the alpha phase bonus*
- Half the employee skill gain bonus*
- Half the press release hype deadline*
- Double the importance of creativity*
- Double the rent cost*
- A tenth of the product reputation factor*
- Double the AI company intelligence*
- 20% more founder dividends*
- Limited the start date to 1980
- Founders are limited to 50% creativity
- Disabled OS development for players until player has 100k fans
- Tax rate is increased to **75%**
_*Compared to the vanilla impossible difficulty_

In all, this mod definitely brings a tough challenge to the game. It might take you many tries to be successful at the start, so we wrote a tutorial down below to help you understand the best tactics to employ with this mod.

## Backstory
_1976: The year that our company was destroyed by an antitrust lawsuit. Once a behemoth of the software industry, it now remains as a shadow of its former glory. However, you, starting off as an intern 10 or so odd years ago, now stand alone as the only remaining employee. The public drown when they hear your company's name, and the government has done anything in its power to prevent you from making a monopoly again. But you're planning for the long-run, and you're thinking waiting for everyone to forget about the past so you can make a massive comeback. Regardless, there's still lots of debt to be paid, and you can't sit there and wait, so go and make some money!_

## Tutorial
- Click the Difficulty drop-down menu in the top-right of the character creation screen, then select impossible.
- Since rent is doubled, the garage costs us $4000 a month, which is 12 times more than your own office will cost your ever month, so consider buying your own plot.
- _(The mod is definitely subject to change a lot in the coming days, so I won't write much more right now, sorry ðŸ˜ž)_

## Notes
- Avoid enabling this difficulty mid-game through the options menu, as you may encounter many bugs.
